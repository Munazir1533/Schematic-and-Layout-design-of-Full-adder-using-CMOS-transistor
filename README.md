`'Abstract'`

This study presents the design and implementation of a Full Adder circuit using CMOS 
transistor technology. The Full Adder is a fundamental component in digital circuits, 
crucial for arithmetic and logical operations. Leveraging CMOS technology, this 
research focuses on optimizing the circuit's performance metrics, such as speed, power 
efficiency, and area utilization. The Full Adder design is realized through the 
integration of complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, 
utilizing their inherent advantages in terms of low power consumption, high noise 
immunity, and compatibility with integrated circuit manufacturing processes. 
Simulation and analysis are conducted using Cadence Virtuoso tools to assess the 
circuit's functionality, performance parameters, and scalability across different process 
nodes. The findings and insights from this study contribute to advancing the 
understanding and application of CMOS-based Full Adder circuits in modern digital 
systems.
